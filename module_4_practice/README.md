## CSS Class Project Brief 

In today’s class, with the Inro knowledge we have of CSS, we will be using the following HTML Elements in building this application.

1. <h1>
2. <ul>
3. <li>
4.<span>
5. <img>

The h1 will contain the header of this project, we will have a list of 5 colors (each list will appear in its shade. I.e. “red” would appear in red, and also have an image next to it representing an item in that color I.e. an image of a red car)

This will be triplicated, the first will be styled using In-line CSS, the second; internal CSS, and the third; External CSS

This will be implemented in a live session
